    <p>
        ThinkPad is a line of business-oriented laptop computers and tablets designed, developed and marketed by Lenovo,
        <br> and formerly by IBM until 2005, when IBM's PC business was acquired by Lenovo. ThinkPads have a distinct black,
         boxy design language, inspired by a Japanese bento lunchbox, which originated in 1990 and is still used in some models.
          Most models also feature a red-colored trackpoint on the keyboard, which has become an iconic and distinctive design 
          characteristic associated with the ThinkPad line.</br>
